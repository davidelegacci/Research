## Hamiltonian Riemannian Game Dynamics
Riemannian game dynamics[^mert] are dynamics for one-population games induced by the payoff vector field. Under some circumstances, such dynamics display Hamiltonian properties[^ali].

## Geometric Aspects of Learning and Evolution in Games
The space of finite normal form games admits a non-canonical direct sum decomposition into the subspaces of non-strategic, potenti, and harmonic games[^can], closely related to the discrete Hodhe decomposition for simplicial complexes. I am interested in an analogue decomposition for games with continuous strategy space (concave games), and continuous population space (population games)
