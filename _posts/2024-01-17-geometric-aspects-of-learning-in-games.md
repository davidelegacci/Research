The space of finite normal form games admits a non-canonical direct sum decomposition into the subspaces of non-strategic, potenti, and harmonic games, closely related to the discrete Hodge decomposition for simplicial complexes. I am interested in an analogue decomposition for games with continuous strategy space (concave games), and continuous population space (population games).
